# Visualization Project: GoogleSheet with Youtube API Appscript

This project uses the Youtube API to scrape youtube channels related to a specific topic (insolvency laws in Spain) and visualizes them by views, likes and activity. The script runs on a daily basis so the visualizations are updated every day. The visualizations are shown in a [blog post](https://presmerats.github.io/data/visualization/googlesheets/2024/10/09/Google-sheets-Viz.html)
